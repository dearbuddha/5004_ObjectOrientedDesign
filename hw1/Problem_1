It follows the rule that the result of the remainder operation can be negative only if the dividend is negative,
and can be positive only if the dividend is positive. Moreover,
the magnitude of the result is always less than the magnitude of the divisor.

 If the value of the divisor for an integer remainder operator is 0, then an ArithmeticException is thrown.

 • 2 % 3 = 2  the divisor and dividend are both positive and the dividend is smaller than the divisor, so the result is equal to the dividend
 • 0 % 3 = 0  Zero modulo any number(except for zero) is zero
 • 3 % 3 = 0  both the dividend and the divisor are positive and are the same number, so the result equals zero
 • -2 % 3 = -2  the sign of the dividend determines the sign of the result, so the result is negative
 • 2 % -3 = 2  the sign of the dividend determines the sign of the result, so the result is positive regardless of a negative dividend
 • -2 % -3 = -2  the sign of the dividend determines the sign of the result, so the result is negative
