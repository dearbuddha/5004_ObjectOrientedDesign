hashCode() method iterates over the container, calling the {hashCode} method on each element (or entry) in the container,
and adding up the results.

equals() method Compares the specified object with this container for equality.
Returns true if the given object is also a same type container, the two containers have the same size,
and every member of the given container is contained in this container.

For the last part: every member of the given container is contained in this container, it requires checking equality.
Two elements with the same content may be considered different if hashCode() is not overridden, resulting in a failure
of the hash-table-based container since the the elements would have two different hash codes.
So overriding equals() alone is not enough for hashing data structures like HashSet, HashMap, etc. hashCode() also
must be overridden.
